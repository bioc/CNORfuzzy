1.1.4:
    o cleaning up for bioconductor release

1.1.3:
	o gaDiscreteT1.R: fix issue when only 1 model was returned within tolerance 
	o reduceFuzzy.R fix bug that causes seg faut (model was not cut properly)
	o defaultParametersFuzzy.R: added nTF to set number of TF to arbitrary value (not tested)
	o cSimulator.R: added nSignals as input to the C function 
	o CNORwrapFuzzy.R: fixed pMutation argument that was not populated
	o src/simulatorT1.c: added nSginals that may be used in the future to return the simResults already cut

1.1.2:
	o gaDiscrete functions return best score as well in the dataframe.

1.1.1:
	o output names of the fields returned by gaDiscrete are now using camel
	  lower case so that plotFit from CellNoptR can be used 
	o add C simulator

1.1.0: increment version to be in agreement with boiconductor policy.
1.0.0: in bioconductor (oct 2012)


0.99.8:
	o add NEWS.Rd in inst
	o move tests in inst/unitTests

0.99.7: 
	o use new CNOlist class, 
    o add test, 
    o fix CNORwapFuzzy (default values), 
    o fix typos in writeNetwork. 
    o defaultParameters were always used in CNORwrapfuzzy (fixed).
    o finalised the vignette.

0.99.6: 
    o remove indexList and simList where possible. 
	o use preprocessing inside CNORwrapFuzzy, 
	o CNOList argument renamed in CNOlist, 
	o add hashtable in  gaDiscrete.

0.99.5: 
    o uniformisation of the names/arguments to reflect changes made in CellNOptR.
